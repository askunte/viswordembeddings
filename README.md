# viswordembeddings
viswordembeddings is a web-based application to help researchers and practitioners explore and analyze word vector embeddings.
It combines implementations of multiple interactive visualization designs that support important tasks to understand embeddings.
The tasks, designs and the rationale behind them are described in a [publication](https://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/Vis/EmbVis/) presented at the [EuroVis 2018](https://www.eurovis2018.org/) conference.

## Running viswordembeddings
viswordembeddings has a backend written in [Python](https://www.python.org), version [3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/).
